# LaTeX Style Guide

## Introduction
The goal of this document is to provide a guide on how the code for a
LaTeX document should be formatted. The reason for this is two fold;
first it is designed to provide readability of the code in the documents
we are working on; second it is designed to make sure there is
consistency between the code written by the various members of the team.
As with any style guide, the guide is about consistency and readability.
If to follow the style guide readability or consistency of the document
must be broken, breaking from the style guide is fine, however in the
case of code consistency, that may be an excuse to clean up old code.

## Code Layout
### Indentation
Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Spaces are preferred to tabs for
consistency between editors; Spaces always show up the same between all
text editors no matter what the settings in the editor is.

Every environment should have be one further indentation level.
```tex
\begin{document}
    Indentation level for document environment
    \begin{table}
        Indentation level for table environment
    \end{table}
\end{document}
```

### Maximum Line Length
Maximum line length will be based on the standard from python
foundations
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length[pep 8]
programming style guide

The maximum line length for all code should be 79 characters.

For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions
(docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72
characters.

Limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have
several files open side-by-side, and works well when using code review
tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns.

The default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the
code, making it more difficult to understand. The limits are chosen to
avoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even if the
tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping lines.
Some web based tools may not offer dynamic line wrapping at all.
